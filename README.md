Write a node JS script named “find_consecutive_runs.js” that accepts as an argument a list of integers.
- It must find in that list all runs of 3 consecutive numbers that increase or decrease by 1
- It should return the list indices of the first element of each run
- If there are no consecutive runs it should output `No Runs Found`

Example run command: `node find_consecutive_runs.js "[1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7, 8, 7]" `
Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7, 8, 7]
Results: [0, 4, 6, 7]

Please respond by 6/9/17 with a github url where I may find your submission.
